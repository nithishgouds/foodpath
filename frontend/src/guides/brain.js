            <h3>1. Oranges</h3>
            <p><strong>Rich in Vitamin C:</strong> Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent mental decline by protecting brain cells from damage by free radicals.</p>
            <p><strong>Supports Overall Brain Function:</strong> It helps with the synthesis of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which play a role in mood regulation and cognitive function.</p>

            <p><strong>Choline for Memory:</strong> Choline is used to produce acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in memory and mood regulation.</p>
            <p><strong>B Vitamins:</strong> Eggs are rich in B6, B12, and folate, which have been linked to slowing mental decline and preventing brain shrinkage.</p>
            <p><strong>Enhances Mood:</strong> Folate and B vitamins also play a role in reducing the risk of depression and cognitive impairment.</p>

            <h3>2. Alcohol</h3>
            <p><strong>Impairs Cognitive Function:</strong> Excessive alcohol consumption can impair memory, decision-making, and motor skills in both the short and long term.</p>
            <p><strong>Linked to Brain Shrinkage:</strong> Chronic alcohol use has been associated with a decrease in brain volume, especially in regions responsible for memory and learning.</p>
            <p><strong>Increases Risk of Dementia:</strong> Heavy drinking significantly increases the risk of developing dementia and other cognitive impairments.</p>
